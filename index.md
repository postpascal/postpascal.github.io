心里有团永恒的火焰🔥(Eternal Flame)。

```
The Eternal Flame was a mystical, inextinguishable flame that contained the true power of the Fire Giant Surtur, and is capable of resurrecting deceased individuals.
```

```
"Okay so let me get this straight. You're gonna put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?"
"A mountain!"
―Thor and Surtur
